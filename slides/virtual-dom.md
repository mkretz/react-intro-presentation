## Virtual DOM

*   Problem: DOM operations are expensive (browser recalculates layout and styles)
*   abstract in-memory representation of the DOM
*   components declaratively represent DOM
*   efficient diff calculation
*   batched manipulations of the real DOM
*   by-product: easy server-side rendering
*   by-product: non-DOM rendering becomes available (e.g. React Native)
